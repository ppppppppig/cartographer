CMake Error at cmake/functions.cmake:101 (message):
  Compiling in Debug mode is not supported and can cause severely degraded
  performance.  You should change the build type to Release.  If you want to
  build in Debug mode anyway, call CMake with -DFORCE_DEBUG_BUILD=True
Call Stack (most recent call first):
